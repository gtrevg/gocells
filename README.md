# Tideland Go Cells

## Description

The *Tideland Go Cells* provide a package for the creation of event based
applications with networked concurrently working cells. The way how they
process the recevied events is defined by behaviors. During the processing
of an event a cell can emit multiple events to its subscribers.

I hope you like them. ;)

## Version

Version 6.0.0 beta 2016-10-22

## Packages

### Cells

Major package providing the infrastructure for event based applications.

### Behaviors

The project already contains some standard behaviors, the number is
still growing.

### Broadcaster

The broadcaster behavior simply emits all received events to all
of its subscribers. It is intended to be used as a top level behavior
to directly rigger multiple handlers instead of emitting an event
manually to those handlers.

### Callback

The callback behavior allows you to provide a number of functions
which will be called when an event is received. Those functions
have the topic and the payload of the event as argument.

### Collector

The collector behavior collects all received events. They can be
retrieved and resetted. It also emits all received events to its
subscribers.

### Configurator

After receiving a ReadConfigurationTopic with a filename as
payload the configuration behavior reads this configuration
and emits it. If it is started with a validator the configuration
is validated after the reading.

### Counter

The counter behavior is created with a counter function as argument.
This function is called for each event and returns the IDs of counters
which are incremented then. The counters are emitted each time and
also can be resetted.

### Filter

The filter behavior is created with a filtering function which is
called for each event. If this function call returns true the event
emitted, otherwise it is dropped.

### Finite State Machine

The FSM behavior implements a finite state machine. State functions
process the events and return the following state function.

### Logger

The logger behavior logs every event. The used level is INFO.

### Mapper

The mapper behavior is created with a mapping. It is called with each
received event and returns a new mapped one.

### Round Robin

The round robin behavior distributes each received event round robin
to its subscribers. It can be used for load balancing.

### Scene

The scene behavior stores a received payload using the event topic as
key in the event scene. So it can be used later by other behaviors
or by the external environments, which can wait until the setting.

### Simple Processor

The simple behavior is created with a simple event processing function.
Useful if no state and no complex recovery is needed.

### Ticker

The ticker behavior emits a tick event in a defined interval to its
subscribers. So they can process chronological tasks beside other
events.
